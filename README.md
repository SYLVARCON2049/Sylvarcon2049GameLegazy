# Virtual Machine Setup Guide for Sylvarcon 2049

This guide explains how to set up the virtual machines required to run the complete Sylvarcon 2049 game experience.

## Overview

The game uses VirtualBox virtual machines to simulate hacking environments. Four main VM packages are required:
- **PlayerVM** - Contains Claire's challenges and the Kali Linux investigation machine
- **Ethan Easy Missions** - Ethan's easy difficulty missions
- **Ethan Medium Missions** - Ethan's medium difficulty missions  
- **Ethan Hard Missions** - Ethan's hard difficulty missions

All VMs are configured to communicate through a dedicated VirtualBox NAT Network called "Sylvarcon" on the 12.0.0.0/24 subnet.

⚠️ **Note:** This is a standalone version that does NOT require Steam to play. The game can be launched directly from the executable.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** This is an unsupported legacy version provided "AS IS". It may contain bugs and is no longer actively maintained. Use at your own risk. We assume no responsibility for any issues, damages, or data loss that may occur from using this software.

## Prerequisites

- VirtualBox 7.0.4 or higher installed
- Sufficient disk space for VM files:
  - Linux VMs: ~15 GB each
  - Windows VMs: ~60 GB each
  - Total space needed: 100+ GB recommended for all missions
- 7-Zip or compatible archive tool to extract .7z files
- Download all four VM packages (.7z files)

---

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Download Required Files

Download the following 7z packages:
1. **PlayerVM.7z** - Contains Claire's missions and Kali investigation VM
2. **Ethan_Easy.7z** - All Ethan easy difficulty missions
3. **Ethan_Medium.7z** - All Ethan medium difficulty missions
4. **Ethan_Hard.7z** - All Ethan hard difficulty missions

### Step 2: Extract PlayerVM

**Location:** `F:\VM-DRIVE (F)\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sylvarcon 2049\redist\PlayerVM\`

1. Navigate to your game installation directory
2. Go to `redist` folder
3. Extract the **PlayerVM.7z** contents into the `PlayerVM` folder using 7-Zip

**Expected structure:**
```
Sylvarcon 2049/
└── redist/
    └── PlayerVM/
        ├── installscript.vdf
        ├── testFile.txt
        ├── VirtualBox-7.0.4-154605-Win.exe
        ├── Claire_Mission_XX/
        └── Sylvarcon-2049/ (Kali Linux VM)
```

### Step 3: Extract Ethan Mission Packages

**Location:** `F:\VM-DRIVE (F)\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sylvarcon 2049\` (root game directory)

1. Navigate to your game installation root directory
2. Extract each Ethan mission package directly to the root:
   - Extract **Ethan_Easy.7z** 
   - Extract **Ethan_Medium.7z**
   - Extract **Ethan_Hard.7z**

**Expected structure:**
```
Sylvarcon 2049/
├── Sylvarcon 2049.exe
├── Sylvarcon 2049_Data/
├── redist/
├── MonoBleedingEdge/
├── Ethan_Easy_01/
├── Ethan_Easy_02/
├── ...
├── Ethan_Medium_01/
├── Ethan_Medium_02/
├── ...
├── Ethan_Hard_01/
├── Ethan_Hard_02/
└── ...
```

⚠️ **Important:** Ethan mission VM folders must be in the game root directory, NOT inside subdirectories.

## VirtualBox NAT Network Configuration

The game requires a specific VirtualBox NAT Network for VM communication. The game automatically creates this network, but you can also configure it manually if needed.

### Automatic Configuration

On first launch, the game will automatically:
1. Create a NAT Network named "Sylvarcon"
2. Configure it with network range 12.0.0.0/24
3. Enable DHCP for automatic IP assignment
4. Start the network

### Manual Configuration Steps

If you need to configure the network manually or troubleshoot network issues:

#### Using VBoxManage (Command Line)

1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator

2. Navigate to VirtualBox installation folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox"
   ```

3. Remove any existing "Sylvarcon" network (if present):
   ```powershell
   .\VBoxManage.exe natnetwork remove --netname Sylvarcon
   ```

4. Create the Sylvarcon NAT Network:
   ```powershell
   .\VBoxManage.exe natnetwork add --netname Sylvarcon --network "12.0.0.0/24" --enable --dhcp on
   ```

5. Start the network:
   ```powershell
   .\VBoxManage.exe natnetwork start --netname Sylvarcon
   ```

6. Verify the network was created successfully:
   ```powershell
   .\VBoxManage.exe list natnets
   ```

   Expected output should show:
   ```
   NetworkName: Sylvarcon
   Network:     12.0.0.0/24
   Gateway:     12.0.0.1
   IPv6:        No
   Enabled:     Yes
   ```

#### Using VirtualBox GUI

1. Open VirtualBox Manager
2. Go to **File** → **Preferences** (or **Tools** → **Network**)
3. Select the **Network** tab
4. Click on **NAT Networks**
5. Click the **+** button to add a new NAT Network
6. Configure the network:
   - **Network Name:** Sylvarcon
   - **Network CIDR:** 12.0.0.0/24
   - **Enable DHCP:** ✓ Checked
   - **Supports IPv6:** (Optional)
7. Click **OK** to save

### Verifying Network Configuration

After configuration, verify that:
- The network "Sylvarcon" appears in VirtualBox NAT Networks list
- Network is enabled (Status: Yes)
- All mission VMs are configured to use this network
- DHCP is enabled for automatic IP assignment

### Troubleshooting Network Issues

**Problem:** VMs cannot communicate with each other

**Solution:**
- Verify all VMs are using the "Sylvarcon" NAT Network (not "NAT" adapter)
- Restart the Sylvarcon network: `VBoxManage natnetwork stop --netname Sylvarcon` then `VBoxManage natnetwork start --netname Sylvarcon`
- Check VirtualBox is not blocked by Windows Firewall
- Ensure virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V) is enabled in BIOS

**Problem:** Network creation fails

**Solution:**
- Run VBoxManage as Administrator
- Remove any conflicting networks with similar IP ranges
- Restart VirtualBox service: `services.msc` → Find "VirtualBox" services → Restart

## Save Game Management

### Save File Location

**Path:** `F:\VM-DRIVE (F)\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sylvarcon 2049\Sylvarcon 2049_Data\saves\`

The save files store your game progress, including:
- Campaign progression
- Completed missions
- Player statistics
- VM configurations

**Save file types:**
```
saves/
├── settings.sav           (2 KB) - Game settings
├── settingsTut.sav       (1 KB) - Tutorial settings
├── SLOT1.sav             (3 KB) - Save slot 1
├── SLOT2.sav             (3 KB) - Save slot 2
└── steam_autocloud.vdf   (1 KB) - Steam cloud config (not used in standalone version)
```

### Restoring Original Save Files

To continue from a specific point in the campaign:

1. Navigate to the saves folder:
   ```
   Sylvarcon 2049_Data\saves\
   ```

2. **Backup your current saves** (optional):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item "saves" "saves_backup" -Recurse
   ```

3. Copy the original save files into the `saves` folder:
   - Replace `SLOT1.sav` and/or `SLOT2.sav` with the original files
   - Keep `settings.sav` for your personal preferences or replace it

4. Launch the game and load the corresponding slot

⚠️ **Note:** Overwriting save files will permanently replace your current progress unless you create a backup.

## Troubleshooting

### VM Not Found Error

**Problem:** Game shows "Virtual Machine not found" error

**Solution:**
- Verify character VM folders are in the game root directory
- Check folder names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure VirtualBox is installed from `redist\PlayerVM\VirtualBox-7.0.4-154605-Win.exe`

### Save File Issues

**Problem:** Cannot load saved game

**Solution:**
- Verify save files are in `Sylvarcon 2049_Data\saves\`
- Check file permissions (should not be read-only)
- Ensure save files are not corrupted (3 KB size is normal)

### Disk Space Issues

**Problem:** Not enough space for VMs

**Solution:**
- Linux mission VMs require approximately 15 GB each when extracted
- Windows mission VMs require approximately 60 GB each when extracted
- Total space needed: 100+ GB for all missions (varies by mission count)
- Ensure at least 150 GB free space on the installation drive for optimal performance
- Consider moving installation to a larger drive or external SSD
- Delete unused mission VMs to free up space if needed

### Network Communication Issues

**Problem:** VMs cannot connect to each other

**Solution:**
- Verify the "Sylvarcon" NAT Network exists in VirtualBox
- Check that all VMs are configured to use NAT Network (not regular NAT)
- Restart the Sylvarcon network (see NAT Network Configuration section)
- Ensure Windows Firewall allows VirtualBox

### 7-Zip Extraction Issues

**Problem:** Cannot extract .7z files

**Solution:**
- Download and install 7-Zip from https://www.7-zip.org/
- Right-click the .7z file → 7-Zip → Extract Here
- Ensure sufficient disk space before extraction
- Verify downloaded files are not corrupted (check file size)
